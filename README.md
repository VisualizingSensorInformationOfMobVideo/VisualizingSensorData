This repository is a continuation of a project from 2013. That project was a mobile app that gave feedback on "bad behaviour" while filming, meaning if you tilt the camera or shake it, you will get a warning message saying that you are tilting or shaking the camera. 

Our goal is to be able to collect (sensor) information of a video while it is being recorded, and then send this continuously to a webserver. If the server decided that the information it gets is good, then it can request a live videostream from this app. 

So we are building our app on top of the project from 2013 (which is our "Initial commit").
